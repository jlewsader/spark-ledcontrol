# spark-ledcontrol

This is a very basic firmware I wrote to play/test the RGB LED control on my Spark Core and the Spark API calls.

At the time, the only options are "red", "green", "blue", and "low" (for brightness control) but I planned to add a manual color control as well.

Comments at end of code show API call example.
